# Dictionary:
## A:

#### ```Array```

Basic composing data type. More on in [complete guide to Arrays](/posts/arrays-in-javascript-complete-guide).

#### ```AST```
*Abstract syntax tree*.

#### ```Abstract Equality```
Comparison operator (```x == y```, where x and y are values, produces true or false).

#### ```AJAX```

#### ```Arrow Functions```

#### ```Authentication```
Who you are (```login``` + ```password```).

#### ```Authorization```
What you are allowed to do (```permissions```).


## B:

#### ```BDD```


## C:

#### ```Call stack```
A stack data structure that keeps information about active function call.

#### ```Composition```


## D:

#### ```Data Access Layer```

#### ```Data type```
Abstraction that has a bounded set of available values and operations that can be performed on these values.

#### ```Dynamic typing```

Means that ariable can represents any value of any type. Read also: [Duck typing](#duck-typing), [Weak typing](#weak-typing).

#### ```Duck typing```
General term for "type checks" that make assumptions about a value's "type"
based on its shape (what properties are present).
"If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck". Read also: [Dynamic typing](#dynamic-typing), [Weak typing](#weak-typing).


## E:

#### ```Event loop```
The mechanism that performs moving functions from the ```event queue``` to ```call stack``` when it becomes empty. Read more about [event loop](/posts/event-loop-in-javascript).

## F:

#### ```Factory```

#### ```First-class Function```

Functions are treated as values – you can assign a function into a variable, pass it around etc. Read also: [Higher-order Function](#higher-order-function).

## G:

#### ```Generator```


## H:

#### ```Higher-order Function```

A function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. Read also: [First-class Function](#first-class-function).

#### ```Hoisting```
Moving all declarations to their respective scopes.


## I:

#### ```Immutable Data```

#### ```Introspection```

The ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime. Read more in the [Complete Guide to Objects](/posts/objects-in-javascript-complete-guide#introspection-in-js).

#### ```Iterable```

An object that contains an iterator that can iterate over its values.

#### ```Iterator```

An object that has the ```next(..)``` method on its interface.

## J:

#### ```JSON```

#### ```JSON-safe```
JSON-safe values consist of values that can be represented as JSON.
Not JSON-safe: ```undefined```s, ```function```s, ```symbol```s, ```object```s with circular references, ```Date```s, ```Infinity```, ```RegExp```s, ```Map```s, ```Set```s, ```Blob```s, ```FileList```s, sparse ```Array```s, ```Typed Array```s or other complex types.

## K:


## L:

#### ```Lexical scope```
[Scope](#scope) that defined during the lexing time.

#### ```Let```

#### ```Localstorage```

## M:

#### ```Map```

#### ```Meta Programming```

#### ```Mixins```

#### ```Memoization```

#### ```Mock```
Mocks or Fakes are faking certain modules or behaviors
to test different parts of a processes.


## N:

#### ```Number```

Numeric data type, that represents both integer and fractional numbers. Read more in the [Complete Guide to Numbers](/posts/numbers-in-javascript-complete-guide).

## O:

#### ```Object```


## P:

#### ```Parasitic inheritance```

#### ```Partial application```

#### ```Promise```


## Q:


## R:

#### ```Reflect```

#### ```Reflection```

The ability for a program to manipulate the values, meta-data, properties and/or functions of an object at runtime.

#### ```Regular Expressions```


## S:

#### ```Scaffolding```

#### ```Scope```
The accessibility of objects (variables/functions) in some part of your program.

#### ```Service workers```

#### ```Set```

#### ```Singleton```

#### ```Symbol```

#### ```SOLID```

#### ```Spies```

#### ```Stack frame```
Block of the [stack](#call-stack) corresponds to some function call that keeps relative information about this call (local variables, parameters, a location where to be returned).

#### ```Stub```

#### ```Superposition```


## T:

#### ```TCO```
*Tail Call Optimization*. Read more about [TCO in JavaScript](/posts/tail-call-optimization-in-javascript).

#### ```TDD```


## U:

#### ```URI```
*Uniform Resource Identifier*. URIs are a standard for identifying documents using a short string of numbers, letters, and symbols. ```URLs```, ```URNs```, and ```URCs``` are all types of URI.

#### ```URL```
*Uniform Resource Locator*. URL is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location and a mechanism for retrieving it.


## V:


## W:

#### ```Weak typing```
Means that compiler can use ```implicit cast```. [Dynamic typing](#dynamic-typing), [Duck typing](#duck-typing).

#### ```WeakMap```

#### ```WeakSet```

#### ```WebWorkers```
